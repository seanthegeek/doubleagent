# Parsers

Which files each parser reads and what it was validated against, how files
are routed to parsers, and the agents that are detected but not parsed.
Back to the [analyzer README](../README.md).

## Parser table

| Agent | Files | Validated against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent-zero` | `usr/chats/<ctxid>/chat.json` (UI log for timestamps, each agent's history for full text and model, `messages/<n>.txt` for long tool results; history-only turns without timestamps when the log was trimmed at 1000 items) under `agent-zero`, `agent-zero/<instance>` or `Desktop/agent-zero`, also the legacy `chats/<ctxid>.json` and `tmp/chats`; project path is the container path `/a0/usr/projects/<name>` | Source at e3051fb, synthetic fixture; see [`research/agent-zero.md`](../research/agent-zero.md) |

No project path is recorded. Model manifests, `config.json`, `backup/`, `launch/` and `logs/` are not read | Source at v0.35.1 (b0c1ca4), synthetic fixture; no real `db.sqlite`, since the desktop app does not exist on Linux; see [`research/ollama.md`](../research/ollama.md) |

| `pi` | `.pi/agent/sessions/<cwd>/<time>_<id>.jsonl` and legacy `.pi/agent/*.jsonl` (session tree; fork entries copied from a collected parent file are dropped; a session that looks driven by little-coder gets a `system` row saying so), `.pi/agent/experimental/sessions/<id>/meta.json` (the durable `session.sqlite` beside it is not parsed) | Source at 2003871, synthetic fixture; see [`research/pi.md`](../research/pi.md) |

| `shellgpt` | Files directly under a `chat_cache/` directory: `AppData/Local/Temp/chat_cache/<id>` and `AppData/Local/Temp/shell_gpt/chat_cache/<id>`, or a copied Linux or macOS temp directory given as loose input. One JSON array of OpenAI messages per chat, `tool_calls` and the pre-1.5.0 `function_call` shape; no timestamp, model or working directory is recorded, so those columns stay empty | Source at a082bd5, synthetic fixture; see [`research/shellgpt.md`](../research/shellgpt.md) |
| `tabby` | Server-side: `.tabby/ee/db.sqlite` or `dev-db.sqlite` (SQLite with WAL sidecars; `threads`, `thread_messages`, `user_events`, thread owner from `users.email`; secret columns never read), the pre-migration backups `ee/db.backup-YYYYMMDD.sqlite` (may hold threads since deleted), and the completion event log `.tabby/events/YYYY-MM-DD.json` (full prompt and generated text). Project is the attached repository URL; no local path is recorded | Source at 21b2904, synthetic fixture; see [`research/tabby.md`](../research/tabby.md) |
| `twinny` | The `rjmacarthy.twinny` row of a VS Code or fork `User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` (`twinny.conversations`). Messages have no time of their own: every row carries the conversation's `updatedAt`. Provider `apiKey`s in the same value are never emitted | Source at 9339bd10, synthetic fixture; see [`research/twinny.md`](../research/twinny.md) |
| `vscode` | `User/workspaceStorage/<hash>/chatSessions/*.jsonl` and `.json` (with the sibling `workspace.json` for the project), `User/globalStorage/emptyWindowChatSessions/*`, `User/globalStorage/transferredChatSessions/*.json`, for Code, Code - Insiders, VSCodium, Positron, Trae and the `.vscode-server*/data` remote layout.

## Row content

The field names each parser relies on are listed in its module docstring
under `doubleagent/parsers/`. Thinking and reasoning blocks are left out
unless `--include-thinking` is passed. The `text` field carries the full
text of each event, line breaks included, so the timeline is a complete
transcript, one event per line. History files are parsed even when the
matching session transcript exists, because they survive session deletion;
filter on `source_file` to drop them.

## Routing files to parsers

Files the collector finds inside a discovered repository through its project
catalog are recorded with agent `project`; the analyzer offers each of them to
every parser and keeps the rows of any parser that accepts it, under that
parser's agent, so `--agent aider` also includes a repository's
`.aider.chat.history.md` and `--agent crush` its `.crush/crush.db`.

Every other file goes to the parsers of the agent the manifest (or, for loose
input, the catalog) attributes it to, plus any parser that names that agent
in its `reads_agents` attribute. Cody and Twinny keep their chats as rows of
the editor's own `state.vscdb`, which the catalog attributes to `vscode` or
to the fork whose `User/` directory holds it (`cursor`, `windsurf`, `pearai`,
`kiro`, `antigravity`); both parsers list all six editors in `reads_agents`,
so that file is offered to them too and the rows come out under `cody` or
`twinny`, and `--agent cody` selects them. `secret://` rows are never read.

## Detected but not parsed

Agents detected but not yet parsed: `chatgpt-desktop`, `copilot-cli`,
`copilot`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `amp`, `factory-droid`, `augment`,
`local-deep-research`, `autogen-studio`, `camel-ai`, `crewai`,
`dify`, `flowise`, `langflow`, `metagpt`, `n8n` and `pydantic-clai`.

The `open-interpreter` parser reads only the current Codex-fork layout
under `.openinterpreter`. The legacy Python tool's
`conversations/*.json` files, which the catalog attributes to
`open-interpreter` too, are detected but not parsed.

The Cursor and Windsurf storage formats are not documented, so a parser
needs format research first: Windsurf's Cascade history is protobuf
(`.pb`) with no published schema, and Cursor's chats are `state.vscdb`
rows whose key layout changes between versions, beside a CLI `store.db`
whose blobs may be encrypted. See
[`cursor.md`](../../collectors/research/cursor.md) and
[`windsurf.md`](../../collectors/research/windsurf.md) in the collector
research.

Files that are not transcripts, such as skills and configuration files,
are detected but not parsed.

## Protobuf and SQLite

Protobuf stores are decoded by `doubleagent/protobuf.py`, a small
schema-driven wire decoder, from field tables written into each parser. For
a closed-source agent the field names come from the descriptors embedded in
its binary. `tools/proto_descriptors.py extract BINARY OUT.json` extracts
them, and `show OUT.json MESSAGE...` and `find OUT.json TEXT` query them. SQLite
stores are copied together with their `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars into a
scratch directory before being opened, so the evidence copy is never touched
and rows still in the write-ahead log are not lost.
