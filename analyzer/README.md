# doubleagent

`doubleagent` is a forensic analyzer of AI agent use on a system. It takes
an archive from the doubleagent collectors, an extracted collection, or any
loose directory tree such as a copied home directory or a mounted disk image,
detects which AI agents left state in it, and parses the transcripts it knows
how to read into one normalised JSONL timeline. It runs on the analyst's
workstation, never on the host under investigation, so unlike the collectors
it may carry dependencies.

It needs Python 3.10 or later. `pip install .` in this directory installs
the `doubleagent` package and the `doubleagent` command with their two
required dependencies: `python-dateutil`, which reads the `--since` and
`--until` times, and `zstandard`, which decompresses Zed threads, Codex and
Open Interpreter `.jsonl.zst` rollouts and OpenClaw's compressed transcript
rows. To run from a checkout without installing, `pip install -r
requirements.txt` and run `python3 -m doubleagent` from this directory.
`--version` prints `doubleagent <version>`. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) lists what changed in
each version, including changes to the `timeline.jsonl` and `sessions.jsonl`
fields.

## Quick start

```sh
# What is in this collection?
doubleagent detect /cases/host01/host01_20261003T165531Z_agent-artifacts.tar.gz

# Build the timeline
doubleagent timeline /cases/host01/host01_*.tar.gz -o /cases/host01/analysis

# Every Bash command Claude Code ran, from the timeline
jq -r 'select(.agent == "claude-code" and .tool_name == "Bash") | .text' /cases/host01/analysis/timeline.jsonl

# Only 1 October 2026 (UTC), or only the last three days
doubleagent timeline /cases/host01/host01_*.tar.gz -o /cases/host01/oct1 --since 2026-10-01 --until 2026-10-01
doubleagent timeline /cases/host01/host01_*.tar.gz -o /cases/host01/recent --since 3d

# Only events whose text mentions curl or wget, with the paired tool calls and results
doubleagent timeline /cases/host01/host01_*.tar.gz -o /cases/host01/net --match 'curl|wget' -i

# A home directory copied off a host by other means, or a mounted image
doubleagent timeline /mnt/evidence -o /cases/host02/analysis --host host02

# A single agent directory copied on its own, under its original name
doubleagent detect /cases/host03/alice/.claude --user alice

# Fleet inventory: one saved collector --inventory stdout per host in a directory
doubleagent inventory /cases/fleet/inventory -o /cases/fleet/fleet-inventory.csv
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does | Writes | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `detect` | Reports the host, users, homes and agents found in an input, with file counts, bytes and whether a parser exists. | stdout only; `--json` for one object | [docs/output.md](docs/output.md#detect) |
| `timeline` | Parses every transcript it can read into one timeline, optionally filtered by time or text. | `timeline.jsonl`, `sessions.jsonl` and `detect.json` in `-o` | [docs/output.md](docs/output.md#timeline), [docs/filtering.md](docs/filtering.md) |
| `inventory` | Merges saved collector `--inventory` output from many hosts into one CSV. | `fleet-inventory.csv`, or the `-o` path | [docs/inventory.md](docs/inventory.md) |
| `catalog` | Prints the bundled catalog, or with `--agents` each agent with `parser` or `detect only`. | stdout only | [docs/inputs.md](docs/inputs.md#detection) |

## Options

```text
doubleagent detect INPUT [--json] [--files] [common options]
doubleagent timeline INPUT -o DIR [--include-thinking] [--agent NAME]...
                         [--since WHEN] [--until WHEN] [--keep-undated] [--match REGEX]... [-i]
                         [common options]
doubleagent inventory [-o FILE] INPUT...
doubleagent catalog [--agents]
doubleagent --version
```

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--json` | `detect`: print one machine-readable object. |
| `--files` | `detect`: also list every attributed file. |
| `-o, --output` | `timeline`: output directory, required. `inventory`: CSV path. |
| `--include-thinking` | `timeline`: emit thinking and reasoning blocks as `thinking` rows. |
| `--agent NAME` | `timeline`: run only this agent's parsers. Repeatable. |
| `--since WHEN`, `--until WHEN` | `timeline`: keep rows inside this window. |
| `--keep-undated` | `timeline`: with a window, also keep rows without a timestamp. |
| `--match REGEX` | `timeline`: keep rows whose `text` matches, with the paired call or result. Repeatable. |
| `-i, --ignore-case` | `timeline`: make every `--match` case-insensitive. |
| `--agents` | `catalog`: list agents and whether each has a parser. |
| `--host NAME` | Host name to record; overrides `collection.json`. |
| `--user NAME` | User to record for every home whose user is empty. |
| `--work-dir DIR` | Where to extract an archive. |
| `--keep-extracted` | Keep the extracted archive. |

[docs/options.md](docs/options.md) has the full meaning of each option,
which subcommands take it, and the full exit-code table.

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Rows or agents were found, or the command always succeeds (`detect --json`, `catalog`, `--version`). |
| `1` | Nothing was found: no timeline rows, no agent artifacts, or no inventory lines. |
| `2` | The input cannot be opened or extracted, an option value is invalid, or the command line is invalid. |

## Parsers

Parsers exist for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI,
Antigravity, Qwen Code, Amazon Q CLI (the `kiro` entry), VS Code chat
(including Copilot Chat), Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code, Continue, Aider,
OpenCode, Crush, Goose, Zed, Tabby, OpenHands, ShellGPT, pi, little-coder,
Letta, Hermes, Agent Zero, Open Interpreter, OpenClaw, nanobot, Sourcegraph
Cody, Twinny, PearAI, Muse Code and Ollama;
[docs/parsers.md](docs/parsers.md) lists the files each one reads and the
evidence it was validated against. Every other agent in the catalog (ChatGPT
Desktop, Copilot CLI and the Copilot editor token store, Cursor, Windsurf,
Amp, Factory Droid, Augment, Local Deep Research, AutoGen Studio, CAMEL,
CrewAI, Dify, Flowise, Langflow, MetaGPT, n8n and the Pydantic AI CLIs) is
detected and reported but not yet parsed, as are the legacy Open Interpreter
Python tool's conversation files. Thinking and reasoning blocks are left out
unless `--include-thinking` is passed.
